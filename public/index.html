NFTs Meet r/place

Make your Graffiti Wall for anyone to graffiti or graffiti you're friends and enemies' Graffiti Walls (and get a static NFT of your edit)

Each Graffiti Wall is connected with a collection of NFTs that contain its history. Each Graffiti Wall can be graffitied 15 times before it is locked forever as a static NFT. ONLY 20 Graffiti Walls can be made in this limited public alpha of the project. "

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
